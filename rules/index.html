Teams will be expected to arrive prior to the start of the competition phase in order to verify their registration with the judges.</li><li>Teams, once registration is verified, may come and go as they please during the competition phase.</li></ul><h3>Teams</h3><ul><li>If an individual attends a local area high school, they must attempt to form a team with that high school using the forthcoming rules.

In the event that this rule is broken, the judges reserve the right to disqualify any team at any time.<br/>(3) - Proper assistance takes the form of answering technical questions, providing moral support, and assisting in preparation prior to the competition. Improper assistance takes the form of a faculty sponsor answering challenges for their students, creating scripts or programs to aid in the answering of challenges, and/or interfering with another team or teams sponsor.<br/></p><h3>Infrastructure</h3><ul><li>Under no circumstances will a team be allowed to attack the competition infrastructure. This includes, but is not limited to: denial of service attacks, cross-site scripting attacks, brute-forcing of judges or opposing teams passwords to gain an unfair advantage, or cross-site request forgery.</li><li>Under no circumstances will a team be allowed to masquerade as surrounding, publicly accessible, infrastructure. This includes, but is not limited to, wireless access points and local area networks (LANs).</li></ul><h3>Scoring</h3><ul><li>Scoring will be based on challenges completed during the competition phase. Each challenge will have an assigned point value by the judges based on difficulty.</li><li>In the event of a tie at the end of the competition phase, the team that achieved the score first, will be held at the higher placement.</li><li>A team may not, under any circumstances, exchange answer keys, solutions, or algorithms with another team.</li></ul><p style="color: #FF5C33;">Any violation of these rules may disqualify a team from the competition or make a team ineligible for prizes. NULLify reserves the right to modify these rules at any time without notice.</p>
